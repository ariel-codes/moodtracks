Using Spotifyâ€™s API Track `valence` scores to track your mood through music :)

This is a fairly standard Rails app, pointing to Rails master to get the latest 7.1 goodies.
I'm using [Phlex](https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex) for OOP views, [RSpotify](https://github.com/guilhermesad/rspotify) for an API wrapper,
and [P5.js](https://p5js.org) for the Unknown Pleasures viz.
